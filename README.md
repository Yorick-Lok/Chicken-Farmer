# Chicken-Farmer
Welcome to my Chicken Farmer project, this one took a little while to make, since I didn't use the tkinter library for a while.
But here it is, finally done.

# How to use
1) Enter a week number. (1-54)
2) Enter the amount of chickens that were on the farm. (2450-2525)
3) Enter the amount of chickens that laid eggs. (Anything below the number of chickens you selected.)
4) Enter the amount of worked hours that week. (1-40)
5) Click the view week Button.

6) Use the Clear Output Button if you'd like to clear the output, you don't need to do this anytime you want to make a new one.
7) Use the Quit Button to exit the program.
